Kaggle Compitition Aerial Cactus Identification https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification

Hi,

In this competition, we were tasked with creation of an algorithm that can identify a specific type of cactus in aerial imagery. I applied different data augmentation methods to increase the trainning data set and tested different CNN models (e.g. VGG-16) to get the best result. Also, dropout were used to prevent overfitting and batch normalization is used to accelerate the learning process.
