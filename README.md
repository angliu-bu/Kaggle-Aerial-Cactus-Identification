# Kaggle-Aerial-Cactus-Identification
Kaggle Compitition Aerial Cactus Identification https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification

Hi,

In this competition, we were tasked with creation of an algorithm that can identify a specific type of cactus in aerial imagery. I applied different data augmentation methods to increase the trainning data set and tested different CNN models to get the best result. Also, dropout were used to prevent overfitting and batch normalization is used to accelerating the learning process.
